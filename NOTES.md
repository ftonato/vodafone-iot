## Notes about tests

I understand the test's concepts and I agree it makes sense on this project, it is tested beyond the components or the flow of information through the _store_. Unfortunately, it was not possible to demystify how to resolve this part.

On [sagas.spec.js](sagas.spec.js) file is possible to follow the idea that I intended to follow.

Thanks,
